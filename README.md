# Training a model from MNIST-data

This R-script trains a model using a deep multi-layer perceptron on the [MNIST-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). Model is trained using [Keras for R](https://keras.rstudio.com) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

The trained model is exported in hdm5-format and used in a [realtime Python web-application](https://github.com/kallemyllymaa/mnist-backend).

This script is heavily based on a [Keras for R-example](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/mnist_mlp.html).
